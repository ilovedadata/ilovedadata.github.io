# Hi everyone 👋, I am ilovedadata, a self-taught dev into data and programming 💻.
This website is about the projects I love doing in my free time and about the things I learn while I struggle to become a better dev ✌️.

## Project 1: Italian Superball simulator
`#Python` `#Numpy` `#Pandas` `#Matplotlib` `#Statistics` `#Probability` `#Random` 

#### Project description and goal
The project is about the **"Italian powerball" (superenalotto)**, a game in which 6 numbers (in fact, 8) are drawn and prizes are won depending on how many numbers you guessed right. The **goal** of this project is to create a realistic game simulator which takes into account the probabilities associated with the wins and the amount of money spent/gained. Thanks to the use of **Data science/Data analysis tools**, dataframes were created to store the drawings and interesting stats about the game were analyzed and plotted.
#### Code structure
The code is made up by 4 main sections:
* Functions section
* Inputs and Structures section
* Script section
* Plotting section
